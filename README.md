# Algorithms review

Algorithms are mostly about intuition, and to get one you have to practice writing them.

Computer scientists learn by experience. We learn by seeing others solve problems and by solving problems by ourselves. Being exposed to different problem-solving techniques and seeing how different algorithms are designed helps us to take on the next challenging problem that we are given. By considering a number of different algorithms, we can begin to develop pattern recognition so that the next time a similar problem arises, we are better able to solve it.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Nodejs + NPM
```

then,

```
npm install -g chokidar-cli

```

### Run

```
chokidar '[name].js' -c 'node [name].js'

```
